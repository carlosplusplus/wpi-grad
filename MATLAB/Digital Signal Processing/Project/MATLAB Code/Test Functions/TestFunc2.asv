% The function emg_notch60() will apply a notch-filtering %
% technique to the EMG signal with the 60Hz power-line    % 
% interference.                                           %

clear all; close all; clc;      % Remove this line when ready.

% The following are inputs to the function:
%   EMG_sigN    = EMG signal with interference that is being filtered
%   N_Filt      = Order of the notch filter

N_Filt          = 7;

% The following are outputs to the function:
%   EMG_sigF    = EMG signal that has been filtered

% Define all static variables:

Fn              = 60;               % Frequency of power line interference
Fs              = 2048;             % Sampling Frequency of EMG, in Hz                           
Fc              = 10;               % Define the cutoff frequency max range to
                                    % the right and left of Fn, in Hz
                                    
Fc_N            = Fc / (Fs/2);      % Normalize Fc in terms of Fs for filtering,
                                    % then define the normalized range at where
                                    % the stopband filter will effectively
                                    % notch out the frequency of interest (Fn)

W_n             = [(((Fn)/(Fs/2)) - Fc_N) (((Fn)/(Fs/2)) + Fc_N)];
