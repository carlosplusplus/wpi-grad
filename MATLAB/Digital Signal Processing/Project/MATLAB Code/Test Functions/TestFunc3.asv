% The following are inputs to the function:
%   EMG_sigN    = EMG signal with interference that is being filtered
%   N_Filt      = Order of the notch filter

% The following are outputs to the function:

% Define all static variables:

% Compute the N-length DFT of the noisy EMG signal:

% Compute the indeces at where the 60Hz signal is located.
% Add +1 to the index since 0Hz is included in the signal.

k2          = N - k1 + 2;

% Compute the nulling-range based off the given bandwidth.

% Null the frequencies around both positive and negative 
% locations of the DFT.
